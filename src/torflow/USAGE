Torflow arguments should be configured as follows:
	arguments="thinktime sliceSize nodeCap socksPort:ctlPort server:port"

The arguments are listed below, along with the value used by real TorFlow if
applicable, and an explanation.

thinktime (0) The amount of time in seconds to wait between complete network
scans. Useful for speeding up debug trials, especially in the minimal case.

sliceSize (50) The number of relays to include in a single slice. Slices that
contain no exit relays, or only exit nodes, are skipped completely.

nodeCap (0.05) The fraction of network bandwidth any one relay is allowed to
have in the final measurement. Any relay that has a measured bandwidth than
(nodeCap * sum of measured bandwidths) has its measurement clipped to that
value.

socksPort (9000) The port used to connect to the Tor instance.

ctlPort The TorControl port, set in the arguments to the tor plugin.

server The name of the test fileserver which TorFlow builds circuits to connect to.

port The port to connect to on the test fileserver.
